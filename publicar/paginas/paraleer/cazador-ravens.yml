  Sahara – Refugee camp – Child – Illness – Imagination\r\n\r\n12-year-old Bachir
  lives in a refugee camp in the Western Sahara, which has been occupied by Moroccan
  troops for many years already. Because of a lung disease, Bachir is confined to
  his tent; the sounds and noises coming through the thin walls are his only connection
  to the outside world. His illness is like a prison that also inhibits his inner
  development. But when Jamida enters into his life, the boy finally gains new hope.
  Thanks to the old man, who is invisible to the boy, Bachir and the readers learn
  about the history of his people and the distant world of the stars. Ricardo Gómez
  conveys the coming-of-age of this boy with great empathy and sympathy for his protagonist.
